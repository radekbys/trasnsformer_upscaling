# trasnsformer_upscaling

I wantet to get familliar with vision transformer architecture so I trained an upscaler using it.
.pt files with trained weigths are too heavy for github, so I don't include them here.

I used the DIV2K dataset aviable at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joe1995/div2k-dataset/data?select=DIV2K_train_HR.
